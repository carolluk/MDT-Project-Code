<p<b><center>About Our App</center></b></P>
<p>
<u><b>Description:</b></u><br>A platform/application for storing personal information from the variety of internet connected devices in the home and on the person. Consumers have numerous internet connected devices and sensors providing a constant stream of data. However, not all of this data is relevant and personalized storage and cloud security is a constant issue for potentially sensitive personal information.  
This application/platform will also analyze the data to determine the relevant pieces of information. This will allow for either direct push notifications to personal devices such as smartphones or provide an internet portal to access these insights.This project will be either an application or platform. Ideally, this will develop into a platform where other developers and users can construct other application on top of the data storage and analysis platform. However, give the time constraints of this project, an application will be more feasible.
As with all Internet of Things devices, security concerns remain a major issue. In an effort to push products out to gain first to market advantage, many new pieces of software are rolled out with major security problems. There are three aspects of security that can be addressed:
Multi-tiered authentication to access aggregated data within the application. Before users can access their IOT dashboard, they would have to authenticate via password and biometric data. Used on a smart phone, this authentication would be fingerprint reading or facial recognition.
Handling of data via lightweight and secure server-side APIs. Relevant encryption may include SSL. Secure output of data from IOT devices being pushed to the API handling the data via end to end encryption.
<p>
<u><b>Practical Application:</b></u><br>A smart fridge can determine if your milk has expired, but do you want the fridge ordering more milk? Probably not. However, getting a push notification to your phone when you leave work telling you that you may need more milk is incredibly useful and timely. This simple example highlights the potential for this application. Various sensors and devices constantly collection data, but not all of this data is useful in and of itself. Merging this variety of data, analyzing it and providing a single platform to interact with these devices could prove significantly more beneficial for consumers than individual devices. Personal information from smartphones and personal health tracking devices can be combined with other sensors to get a more holistic view of the quantified self. 
<p>
<u><b>Novelty:</b></u><br>Siemens estimates that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion internet connected devices. Currently, applications such as these do not exist in the marketplace. If it does, one has not yet reached a critical mass leaving this area very open to innovation and new entrants, such as our group. Our idea will also provide one uniformed platform for sharing data. Some applications exist to monitor a subset of potential, such as quantified self. However, a fully encompassing product does not yet exist. As well, many devices attempt to get users to interact with the device via proprietary platforms for individual devices. This would provide an open platform that could connect a wide array of devices.

<p>
<b>Economic Impact:</b><br>This product would be a low end disruption in the internet connected device market. Currently, various devices provide APIs and other ways to interact with the individual devices. However, connecting all of these together and creating a central location for all the data would be time consuming or expensive for an individual. This product will allow numerous individuals to connect these devices together and analyze this data at a significantly lower cost.  
<p>
<u><b>Why:</b></u><br>In a recent <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/ten_it-enabled_business_trends_for_the_decade_ahead">McKinsey report</a>, the internet of things was considered one of the top IT trends of the next decade. There are numerous devices in the marketplace that connect to the internet and provide information about devices and sensors. However, the majority of this information is just noise. Sensors are constantly reading data, but it is likely too computationally intensive for these devices to filter out the useless information. Thus, a secure distributed platform is necessary to accommodate the future Internet of Things. This platform or application will manage the data from the numerous devices users are sure to have in the future. Additionally, actions can be taken to provide a seamless easy interface (e.g. you are coming home early from work, this platform can change the temperature of the thermostat, turn the lights on, etc. instead of changing these devices individually).
<p>
<u><b>Deliverables:</b></u><br>A demo version of this product is absolutely possible. A software application that collects information from a few devices via an API can be built. This platform should easily be able to provide a few key analyses as well. Next, an interface to access an analyzed subset of this data via the internet would also be do-able. 
The main deliverable will be the software application described in this document. The key features of this software will be an interface that will allow users to connect devices and view their data. This application will connect to 2 different internet connected devices and gather data from these devices. Given the timeline of this project, building the entire platform that will allow for push notification and additional application development may not be feasible. However, this application will at least provide a web based interface for viewing and interacting with the data gathered by the application. As well, this application will conduct some basic analyzes on the data that has been connected.
